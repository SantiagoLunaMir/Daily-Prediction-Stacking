Here is an example of different comparasions! Note (With the 'Close' column of the dataset is done all the train an prediction in the image).
Using a staking model (Linear Regression for daily prediction, for a bigger window of prediction, neural networks are suggested):
  - Linear Threshold (LT)
  - Transformer Neural Network
  - Self-Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive Model (SETAR)
